# Aerodynamic Minivan Concept – Electric Cargo Vehicle

## Overview

This project explores aerodynamic optimization for a compact **electric minivan** designed to carry **large cargo** while minimizing drag. The vehicle features a **streamlined body** with experimental flow control techniques to enhance aerodynamic efficiency, especially important for electric vehicles where range and energy usage are critical.

## Vehicle Dimensions

- **Width:** 1500 mm  
- **Length:** 4250 mm  
- **Height:** 1200 mm  
- **Type:** Electric Minivan (Low-profile, large cargo volume)
- Tires with only 155mm width
- The car is still a boxy design which is easy to load 

## Aerodynamic Design Highlights

### 1. **Streamlined Profile**
- The overall shape has been tapered and smoothed to reduce flow separation drag.
- Roofline and underbody are optimized for attached flow at moderate highway speeds.


### 2. **High-Pressure Redirection**
- Instead of a traditional front radiator, the **high-pressure airflow** is redirected **downward** through the front intake area.
- This redirected flow energizes the **underfloor boundary layer**, helping reduce wake turbulence and improving underbody flow characteristics.

### 3. **Strake Integration**
- A series of **strakes (aerodynamic fins)** are strategically placed under the floor.
- These help **re-energize the flow**, manage vortex structures, and improve ground effect stability.

### 4. **Canopy and Rear Flow Refinement**
Numerous iterations of the canopy’s rear end were evaluated to reduce wake recirculation and drag while improving flow attachment.


## Goals & Benefits

- Reduce overall **drag coefficient** (Cd) to improve electric range.
- Maintain **large cargo space** without compromising aerodynamic efficiency.
- Demonstrate alternative front-end design strategies in EVs (no large cooling requirement).
- Cr down to 0.180: Drag: 130.2N at 25m/s-1 (90 kph), Drag Power: 3255W
